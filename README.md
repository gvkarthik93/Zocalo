5. If the server starts correctly, it should show
    `Server Running on Port:  8002`
6. Open browser, go to [http://localhost:8002/](http://localhost:8002/)
7. We've create a test login credential:

    `$cd ..` and start the server
    `$python appserver.py`
5. If the server starts correctly, it should show
    `Server Running on Port:  8002`
6. Open browser, go to [http://localhost:8002/](http://localhost:8002/) to test the server
7. Open [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/) and signup with a new account credentials.
8. Install heroku CLI from [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)
9. Now on the terminal run the command `$heroku create` (Note that the command should run in the project directory)
10. After running the above command, push the code from git repository to heroku for creating deployment packet using the following command: `$git push heroku master`
11. If you've already created an app on heroku, then run the following command to connect to the app: `$heroku git:remote -a project-name`
12. fter pushing the code to heroku, heroku creates a deployment packet. Now to run the server on heroku, run the following command: `$heroku start`
13. The above command will start the server on heroku and the application is now open on internet.
